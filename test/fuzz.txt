Fuzzing with american fuzzy lop
-------------------------------

ujson can be fuzzed with 'afl' (see http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl). A simple driver program, 'ujson_fuzz', is included, which simply reads JSON from stdin and parses it. A folder with a few test cases is also included.

The simplest way to invoke 'afl' is:

>afl-fuzz -i ../path-to-testcases-dir -o findings-dir test/ujson_fuzz
